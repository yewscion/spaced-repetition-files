**A Personal Collection of SR "cards".**

*Last Updated: 2022-08-30 (W35) 01:59:16 GMT*

This repo is a collection of Org files I use with [Org Drill](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html) and [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) to
memorize new pieces of information.

There are no install/usage information included here, as they are largely
just data files. However, if You want to use them, opening the files in GNU
Emacs is a good starting point.
